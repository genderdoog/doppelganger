## What is this?

This project's aim is to recreate the doppelganger website briefly shown on Gumball's laptop during *The Amazing World Of Gumball* episode "The Copycats" (S5 E12) via a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLxBYzEjeZA&t=13s) is a YouTube clip of that scene. 

### Goals of this project
1. Follow all relevant web standards. I wanted the final result to be something that anyone could easily host and get up and running without much hassle.
2. Replicate the experience of the webpage one to one in that small clip. For example, if the cursor lagged a certain amount, it also needs to lag in this recreation.

## Features
- Fully responsive design which adapts to any screen size.
- All features accessible with only keyboard controls.
- Dedicated mobile view designed for a optimised browsing experience on pocket sized devices.
- Custom cursor and context menu faithfully recreated to match the original source material.
