## What is this?

This project's aim is to recreate the doppelganger website briefly shown on Gumball's laptop during *The Amazing World Of Gumball* episode "The Copycats" (S5 E12) via a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLxBYzEjeZA&t=13s) is a YouTube clip of that scene. (I reference to this clip as "source material" sometimes in my docs/comments).

### Goals of this project
1. Follow all relevant web standards, thus ensuring compatibility across any modern(ish) web browser. I wanted the final result to be something that anyone could feasably host without much hassle.
2. Replicate the experience of the webpage one to one in that small clip. For example, if the cursor lagged a certain amount, it also needs to lag in this recreation.

## Features
- Responsive; adapts to any screen size.
- Keyboard friendly navigation and controls.
- Dedicated mobile view designed for a optimised browsing experience on pocket sized devices.
- Custom cursor and context menu faithfully recreated to match the original source material.
